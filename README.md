# Final-Project
EPI 590R Final Project

1. Code should all be in R file for first few steps. 

*You won't need to run the first few lines of code in the R file, or the last code about setting up renv; they are just there for reference of how I connected to Github and originally got my dataset.

**Also feel free to ignore any lines of code about install.packages; they should already be in renv lock. (But still run any code for library() ).


2. Quarto code should all be in the qmd dataset.
