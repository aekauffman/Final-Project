# Final-Project
EPI 590R Final Project

1. Code should all be in R file for first few steps. 

You won't need to run the first few lines of code in the R file, or the last code about setting up renv; they are just there for reference of how I connected to Github and originally got my dataset.


2. Quarto code should all be in the qmd dataset.
